# ESP8266-ESP-01-ARDUINO-POWERED-MQTT-LEAK-DETECTOR-REMOTE-ALARM-RECEIVER
NO ONE enjoys water/liquid of any kind leaking into places that it just doesn't belong. The worst part of that scenario is that it tends to happen where you currently 'happen not to be'...your basement, a utility closet, maybe even your attic or garage. Setting up a WiFi connected sensor in a potential 'leak-zone', and a remote alarm nearer to you waiting for meaningful alarm messages sent from that sensor might be a GREAT IDEA!  MQTT is the key to this project, just as it was in the ESP8266Arduino-MQTT-Memo-Minder project. The only difference is that instead of sending MQTT text messages from an App on your phone, the MQTT messages will be sent from the re-configured code on the ESP8266ESP-01-Arduino-Powered-Leak-Detector.
